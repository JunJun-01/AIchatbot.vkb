An expert system is a computer system that simulates the decision-making abilities of a human 
expert in artificial intelligence. Expert systems, rather than using traditional procedural code, are 
to handle complicated issues by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, which are primarily 
represented as if-then rules. Expert system makes decisions based on both facts and heuristics to 
solves complex problems that are initially solved by human experts in specific domains as it is 
based on the knowledge acquired from an expert. There are many types of specific knowledge 
domain to a problem domain for examples science, medicine, finance, etc. The more experience 
that is entered into the expert system, the better the system's performance in decision making will 
be. The function of an expert system includes providing advice to users, used for classification, 
diagnosis of problems, and implementing plans. (mone, 2018)
The purpose of this assignment is to gain an extensive knowledge of an expert system and 
implement a knowledgebase system that serves as an information repository and consultant. In 
other words, a chatbot that uses knowledge specific to a problem area to provide “Expert Quality” 
performance in that application area will be develop. In this project, a chatbot application named 
DisBot that specialize in the disaster management domain and can provide updated disaster 
information and solution will be develop and implemented by the project team. As natural disaster 
happens quite frequently in many countries, the goal of DisBot is to deliver trustworthy knowledge 
of what to do when a natural disaster occurs in the case of emergency and thus the target range of 
users for DisBot should be everyone across the globe. By making DisBot into novice level users, 
DisBot should be useable by anyone, despite being an elderly or a young teenager. The project 
team will do everything necessary to make the system as user-friendly as possible.
